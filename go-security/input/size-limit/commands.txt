# To prevent requests taking too much memory to be satisfied,
# use I/O size limits for HTTP request body.

# Launch the server:
go run .

# Send a big-sized payload
curl -d@pi.txt http://localhost:8080

# with the amount of bytes it needs to keep in memory,
# while with "safe" strategy it responds after a hitting max size limit.
