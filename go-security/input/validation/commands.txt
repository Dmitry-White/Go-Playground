# Launch the server:
go run .

# Send an invalid payload
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080 \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d @payload.json

# Observe that with "hacky" strategy the payload is not validated
# and unintended data might affect your system,
# while with both "basic" & "safe" strategies check request body
# althoug with different complexity/scalability/readability - 
# "safe" strategy is more idiomatic to Go since it uses struct tags.
