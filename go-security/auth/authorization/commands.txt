# Launch the server:
go run .

# Send requests to different endpoints
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/profile?user=joe
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/profile?user=jane
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/profile?user=joe
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/profile?user=jane

# Notice that some requests work for every user
# while other requests require authorization from users.

# There's a number of Access Control models (DAC, RBAC, ABAC, etc)
# and at the same time a number of access control methods that implement them
# (ACLs, group policies, login/passwords, etc).
# Example of RBAC: Windows Groups, AWS IAM
# Example of ACL: Filesystem ACL in Linux, Network ACL in firewalls
