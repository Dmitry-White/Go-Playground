# Launch the server:
go run .

# Send requests to different endpoints
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080?health
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080?messages

# Notice that some requests require authentication.
# Authentication is done via "Authorization: Bearer X" header.

# Send requests to the securded endpoints with a correct header:
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/messages \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer crypto"
